HM Dot (Salmonella Typhi) (igG,igM

TEST RESULT
SALMONELLA TYPHI DOT - IgM NEGATIVE
SALMONELLA TYPHI DOT - IgG POSITIVE
Interpretation
Typhidot is a medical test consisting of a dot ELISA kit that detects IgM and IgG antibodies against the outer

membrane protein (OMP) of the Salmonella typhi. The typhidot test becomes positive within 2-3 days of infection and
separately identifies IgM and IgG antibodies. The test is based on the presence of specific IgM and igG antibodies to a

specific 50Kd OMP antigen, which is impregnated on nitrocellulose strips. IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG
signifies remote infection. The most important limitation of this test is that it is not quantitative and resuit is cnly positive
or negative. Whereas a detailed Widal test can tell the titres of specific antibodies. However both tests lack sensitivity

and specificity.
