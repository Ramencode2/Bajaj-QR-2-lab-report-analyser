Specimen : PT PLASMA
Comment :

1. INR is the parameter of choice in monitoring adequacy of oral anticoagulant therapy. Appropriate therapeutic range
varies with the disease and treatment intensity
2. Prolonged INR suggests potential bleeding disorder / biceding complications
3. Results should be clinically correlated
4. Test conducted on Citrated plasma
RecommendedTherapeutic range for Oral Anticoagulant therapy
INR 2.0-3.0 :
Treatment of Venous thrombosis & Pulmonary embolism:
Prophylaxis of Venous thrombosis (High risk surgery):
Prevention of systemic embolism in tissue heart vaives,
AMI, Valvular heart disease & Atrial fibrillation:
Bileafiet mechanical valve in aortic position
INR 2.5-3.5:
Mechanical prosthetic vaives
Systemic recurrent emboli
Comments:Prothrombin time measures the extrinsic coagulation pathway which consists of activated Factor VII (Vila),
Tissue factor and Proteins of the common pathway (Factors X, V, il & Fibrinogen). This assay is used to control long
term oral anticoagulant therapy, evaluation of liver function & to evaluate coagulation disorders specially factors
involved in the extrinsic pathway like Factors V, Vil, X, Prothrombin & Fibrinogen.
