Disclaimer :

eGFR which is primarily based on Serum Creatinine is a derivation of

CKD-EPI 2009 equation normalized tol.73 sq.m BSA and is not applicable to individuals

eGFR tends to be less accurate when Serum Creatinine estimation is indeterminate e.g.

below 18 years. patients at extremes of muscle mass, on unusual diets etc. and samples

This report is based on the specimen/s received. The report may need to be correlated clinically as laboratory investigations are
dependent on multiple variables. These results should not be reproduced in part.
