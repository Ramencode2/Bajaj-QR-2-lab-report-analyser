REMARKS:-
In vitro quantitative determination of HbAIC in whole blood is utilized in long term monitoring of glycemia .
‘he HbAIC level correlates with the mean glucose concentration prevailing in the course of the patient's
‘ecent history (approx - 6-8 weeks) and therefore provides much more reliable information for glycemia

monitoring than do determinations of blood glucose or urinary glucose.
'tis recommended that the determination of HbAIC be performed at intervals of 4-6 weeksduring Diabetes

Mellitus therapy
Results of HbAIC should be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical

examinations
and other findings
