Interpretation(s)

CREATININE [GFR- EPI-- Kidney disease outcomes quality initiative (KDOQI) guidelines state that
it gives a rough measure of number of functioning nephrons Reduction in GFR implies progre:
Ihe GIR Is a calculation based on serum creatinine test.

Creatinine is mainly derived from the metabolism of creatine in muscle, and its generation is proportional to the total muscle mass, As a result, mean creatinine generation
is higher in men thart in women, in younger than in older individuals, and in blacks than in whites

* Creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted into urine at @ relatively steady rate

~ When kidney function is compromised, excretion of Creatinine decreases with a consequent increase in blood ereatinine levels. With the creatinine test, a reasonable
estimate of the actual GFR can be determined,

~ This equation takes into account several factors that impact creatinine production, including
= CKD EPI (Chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration) equation performed better} eauetion especially when GFR is high(>60 mi/min per 1.73m2).. This
formula has less bias and greater accuracy which helps in early diagnosis and also reducesillgrate oF false Positive diagnosis of CKD.
