LIVER FUNCTION TESTS

Bilirubin (Total) 34.04 mg/dl 0.3-1.20 mg/dl
Bilirubin (Direct) : 0.29 mg/dl 0-0.4 mg/dl
Bilirubin (Indirect) : : 0.82 mg/dl 0-0 mg/dl

incressed in ; acute or chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, biliary tract obstruction, toxic hepatitis, neonatal jaundice (neonatal hyperbilirubinemia),
er liver enzyme absormalities (dubin-johnson, rotor, gilbert, crigler-najjar syndromes), fasting, hemolytic disorders. Hepatotoxic druds.

-Alkaline Phosphatase : 123.4 lun 60-170 iu/l

Increased In :Obstructive hepatobiliary disease, bone disease, hyperparathyroidism, rickets, benign familiar hyperphosphatasemia ,pregnancy,GI
disease, Hepatotoxic drug. Decreased In: Hypophosphatasia.

Alanine Transaminase (ALT/SGPT) > 35.21 IU/L 5-50 U/L
Serum, Method: UV Kinetic

Aspartate Transaminase (AST/SGOT) : 36.78 IU/L $-50 U/L
Serum, Method: UV Kinetic

Total Proteins : 6.82 gm/dl 68 gmidi

Albumin : 3.74 gm/dl 3.5-4.5 gmidl

Globulin : 3.08 gm/dl 2.5-3.5 mg/dl

A/G Ratio : 1.21 mgm% 1.3.4.0 mgm%

The pattern of liver test abnormiality is hepatocellular. The AST is typically in the 100 to 200 IU/L range, even in severe disease, and the ALT
level may be normal, even in severe cases, The AST level is higher than the ALT level, and the ratio is greater than 2:1 in 70% of patients.

C. REACTIVE PROTEIN
S. REACTIVE PROTEIN : 28.87 mg/L 06

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important and evolutionarily ancient component of the innate immune response. CRP has been described as
“the prototypical acute-phase reactant to infections and inflammation in human beings.” In the clinical setting, CRP is used “as a clinical
indicator of acute infections and response to treatment, and to assess inflammatory status in chronic diseases. Initially it was thought that
CRP might be a pathogenic secretion as it was elevated in people with a variety of illnesses including cancer. However, discovery of synthesis
in the liver demonstrated that it is manufactured by the human body.

The fact that CRP is an independent predictor of stroke and coronary artery disease but also a key contributor to effective bacterial
clearance, underscores the importance of microbes in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Some patients on the Marshall Protocol (MP)

have reported temporary increases in CRP, an observation which is consistent with a heightened immune
