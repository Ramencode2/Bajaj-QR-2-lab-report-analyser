TEST REPORT

CA-125 (Ovarian Cancer Marker), Serum

Investigation Observed Value Biological Reference Interval
CA+125. 69.5 0-35 U/mL -
Mothod:ECLIA

Note Kindly correlate clinically

Interpretation: Serum CA-125 assay values are useful for monitoring the course of disease in patients with invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer. Persistantly rising CA 125 assay values are associated with malignant disease and poor
response to therapy, where as decreasing CA 125 assay values indicate favorable response to therapy. In women
with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma who had undergone first-line therapy and were candidates for diagnostic
second-look procedures, a CA-125 assay value greater than or equal to 21 U/mL was found to be indicative of the
presence of residual tumour. But however a CA 125 assay value below 21 U/mL does not indicate the absence of
residual ovarian cancer because patients with histopathologic evidence of ovarian carcinoma may have CA125
assay values with in normal ranges.Elevations of CA 125 assay values have been reported in approx. 1-2 % of
healthy individuals with non malignant conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, endometrosis, first trimester
pregnancy, ovarian cysts and pelvic inflammatory disease. Elevations of CA125 assay values during the menstrual
cycle are also reported. Non-ovarian malignancies in which elevated CA125 assay values are reported
includecervical, liver,pancreatic,lung,colon,stomach, biliary tract,uterine, fallopian tube,breast and endometrial

carcinomas.
