loterpretation; A quantitative automated hematology analyser is a screening device used to classify and enumerate
the RBC, W8C, Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, PCV, MPV and Platelet parameters for venous anticoagulated whole blood
which are collectively called as complete blood counts.CBP is a screening tool which helps in the diagnosis of a
variety of conditions and diseases such as anemia, feukemia, bleeding disorders, and infections. This test is also
useful in monitoring response to (reatment. As results are generated by a fully automated analyser, the differential
count is computed from a {otal of several thousands of cells, The differential count appears in decimalisod numbers
and may not add upto exactly 100. It may fall between 99 and 101,
