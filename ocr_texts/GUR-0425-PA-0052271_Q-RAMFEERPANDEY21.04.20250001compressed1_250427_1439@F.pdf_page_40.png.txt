HAEMATOLOGY

HB A1C 5.87 %

EXPECTED VALUES :-

Metabolicaly healthy patients = 48-6.0 % HbAIC
Good Control = 6.0-6.8 % HbAIC

Fair Control = 6.8-8.2 % HbAIC

Poor Control = >8.2 % HbAIC

REMARKS:- .
In vitro quantitative determination of HbAIC in whole blood is utilized in long term monitoring of glycemia .

The HbAIC level correlates with the mean glucose concentration Prevailing in the course of the patient's
recent history (approx - 6-8 weeks) and therefore provides much more reliable information for glycemia

monitoring than do determinations of blood glucose or urinary glucose.
It is recommended that the determination of HbAIC be performed at intervals of 4-6 weeksduring Diabetes

Mellitus therapy

Results of HbAIC should be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical
examinations
and other findings
