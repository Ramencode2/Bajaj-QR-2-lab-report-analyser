HbAic
Sample Type- Whole blood EDTA
HbAic 6.1 & (H) % <5.7
Method - HPLC
Result A1C
Normal less than 5.7 %
Prediabetes 5.7 % to 6.4 %
Diabetes 6.5 % or higher
Interpretations:

1. HDbAIC has been endorsed by clinical groups and American Diabetes Association guidelines 2017 for
diagnosing diabetes using a cut off point of 6.5%

2. Low glycated haemoglobin in a non diabetic individual is often associated with systemic inflammatory
diseases, chronic anaemia (especially severe iron deficiency and haemolytic), chronic renal failure and liver
diseases. Clinical correlation suggested.

3. In known diabetic patients, following values can be considered as a tool for monitoring the glycemic control.

Excellent control-6-7 %

Fair to Good control — 7-8 %
Unsatisfactory control — 8 to 10 %
Poor Control — More than 10 %
