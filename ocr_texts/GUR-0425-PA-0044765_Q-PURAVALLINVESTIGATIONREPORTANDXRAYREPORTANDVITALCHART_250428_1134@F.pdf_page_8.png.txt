Comments

Vitamin D is acquired either by exposure to sunlight or ingestion of food containing food vit D. It is
metabolized to vit D, 25 hydroxy in the liver in the first step by vit D,25-hydroxylase system. A small amount
of it further gets metabolized by hydroxylation in kidney to vit D 1,25 dihydroxy. Since vit D, 25 hydroxy is
the predominant circulating form of Vit D in normal population, it is considered to be the most reliable index
of vit D status.

The measurement of 25-OH-D is becoming increasingly important in the
various disorders of calcium metabolism associated with Rickets, pregnancy,
nutritional and renal osteodystrophy, hypoparathyroidism, and
