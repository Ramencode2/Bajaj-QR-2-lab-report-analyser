Interpretation:

e Thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland that is normally located in the lower front of the neck. The thyroid’s job is to make thyroid hormones, which are|
secreted into the blood and then carried to every tissue in the body. Thyroid hormones help the body use energy, stay warm and keep the brain, heart, muscles, and othet
organs working as they should.

¢ Thyroid produces two major hormones: triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). If thyroid gland doesn’t produce enough of these hormones, you may experience
symptoms such as weight gain, lack of energy, and depression. This condition is called hypothyroidism.

e Thyroid gland produces too many hormones, you may experience weight loss, high levels of anxiety, tremors, and a sense of being on a high. This is called
hyperthyroidism.

« TSH interacts with specific cell receptors on the thyroid cell surface and exerts two main actions. The first action is to stimulate cell reproduction and hypertrophy
Secondly, TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to synthesize and secrete T3 and T4.

e The ability to quantitate circulating levels of TSH is important in evaluating thyroid function. It is especially useful in the differential diagnosis of primary (thyroid) from]
secondary (pituitary) and tertiary (hypothalamus) hypothyroidism. In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are significantly elevated, while in secondary and tertiary}
hypothyroidism, TSH levels are low.
