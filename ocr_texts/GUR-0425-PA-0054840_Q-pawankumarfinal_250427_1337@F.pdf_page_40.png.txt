Result > mm induration is seen after 48 Hours of incubation .

Note :- A negative test should be accepted as proof of absence of hypersensitivity only
after normal reactivity to non-specific irritants has been demonstrated. A positive

tuberculin reaction does not necessarily diagnose the presence of active diseas.

CLINICAL NOTES

AFB testing may be used to detect several different types of acid-fast bacilli, but it is most commonly used to identify an
active tuberculosis (TB) infection caused by the

most medically important AFB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacteria are called acid-fast bacilli because they are
rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) that can be seen under

the microscope following a staining procedure in which the bacteria tetain the color of the stain after an acid wash
(acid-fast). AFB Smear and CBNAAT negative AFB

smear may mean that no infection is present, that symptoms are caused by something other than mycobacteria, or that the
mycobacteria were not present in sufficient

numbers to be seen under the microscope. Usually three samples are collected to increase the probability that the organisms
will be detected. Nevertheless, if AFB smears

are negative and there is still a strong suspicion of a mycobacterial infection, then additional samples may be collected and
tested on different days. A smear negative

sample may still grow mycobacteria since the culture media allows low numbers of bacteria that cannot be seen ina
microscopic examination to multiply and be detected.
