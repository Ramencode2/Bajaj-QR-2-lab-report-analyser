HAEMATOLOGY

HB AIC 5.65 %
EXPECTED VALUES :-

Metabolicaly healthy patients = 48-60 % HbAIC

Good Control = 6.0-6.8 % HbAIC

Fair Control = 6.8-8.2 % HbAIC

Poor Control = >8.2 % HbAIC
REMARKS:-
'n vitro quantitative determination of HbAIC in whole blood is utilized in long term monitoring of glycemia .
'he HbAIC level correlates with the mean glucose concentration prevailing in the course of the patient's
recent history (approx - 6-8 weeks) and therefore provides much more reliable information for glycemia
monitoring than do determinations of blood glucose or urinary glucose.
[tis recommended that the determination of HbAIC be performed at intervals of 4-6 weeksduring Diabetes

Mellitus therapy

Results of HBAIC should be assessed in conjunction with the patient's medical history, clinical
examinations
and other findings
