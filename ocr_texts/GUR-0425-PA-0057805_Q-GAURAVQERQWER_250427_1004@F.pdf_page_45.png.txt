SEROLOGY

C-REACTIVE PROTEIN(QUANTITATIVE 95:00 mg/l ili
C-reactive protein (CRP) is serum protein synthesized in the liver, CRP level increases within hours of an acute in injury or

the onset of inflammation in conditions like septicemia, meningitis, inflammatory disorders,post surgery or myocardial

infarction. It is 8 semi quantitative test based on the principle agglutination.

RESULT: WIDAL TEST IS POSITIVE.

In typhoid fever, the H titre 1s elevated earlier and more frequently than the O titre. Antibody rise ts maximal during the |
second week of illness. Antibiotic treatment did not affect the rise of antibody titre in typhoid fever. A single Widal test in |
an unvaccinated patient showing H and/or O titres greater than or equal to 1;160 and typhoid-like symptoms is strongly |
suggestive of typhoid fever. It also appears that H titre is more useful than O titre, More false positives are found than
false negatives. Under these circumstances, the clinicat picture is the decisive factor in making @ diagnosis of
typhoid. PMID: 7342378 [PubMed - indexed for M With the cut off value of anti TO =1:80 and anti TH7=1:160 Widal test
had relatively good NPV (98.9%), but PPV was very low (5.7%). Positive predictive value is more important than other
measure of clinical diagnostic methods because it gives the proportion of patients with positive test results that are
correctly diagnosed but it is highly affected by a prevalence of the discase. In this study only 7 (2.5%) had culture proven
febrile typhoid fever. So a negative Widal test result has a good predictive value for the absence of the disease Dut a |
positive result would have a low predictive value for the presence of typhoid fever [9].
