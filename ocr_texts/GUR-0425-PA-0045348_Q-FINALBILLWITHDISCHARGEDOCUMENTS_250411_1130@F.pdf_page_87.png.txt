PROCALCITONIN 0.93 ng/ml 0.0 - 0.50

See Procalcitonin (PCT) is a prohormone expressed by neuroendocrine cells (C cells of thyroid,
pulmonary and pancreatic tissues) present in very low levels in healthy individuals.
Measurement of PCT can be used as a marker of severe sepsis and generally prades well
with the degree of sepsis. Evidence is emerging that PCT levels can recuice unnecessary
antibiotic prescribing in lower respératory tract infections.

Increased Levels

Infectious — Bacterial infections leading to Septic shock / Severe sepsis, Community
acquired respiratory tract infections & Ventilator induced pneumonia

Non Infectious — Severe Cardiogenic shock, organ perfusion anomalies, Small cell lung
cancer or Medullary C-cell carcinoma of thyroid, major trauma, surgical intervention &
severe bums, treatment which stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines &
Neonates (<48 hrs. after birth)

Clinical Use

As a prognostic marker to support outcome prediction in sepsis patients.

As an indicator of severity and major complications in acute pancreatitis,

As 2 guide for the necessity of antibiotic therapy and to monitor success of treatments in
